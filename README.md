# Implementation of Caesar Cipher 🔑

Develop a Python program to **encrypt** and **decrypt** text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.  
The program allows users to:  
- Input a message 📄  
- Specify a shift value 🔢  

Perform encryption and decryption based on the user’s choice.  

---

### 📌 Observations:

1. **Two stages are included:**
   - 🔐 **Encryption**
   - 🔓 **Decryption**
2. **Shifting/Rotating text** as per the user’s choice.  

---

### 🎯 Outcome:

- Gained insights into the **cryptography field** 🔑.  
- Understood the basics of **encryption and decryption** 🔄.  
- Learned how **shifting works** using ASCII code ✨.
